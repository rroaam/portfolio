## The Brief

LIV Las Vegas approached us to develop a comprehensive creative campaign for their 2026 launch. The challenge: differentiate in an oversaturated Vegas nightlife market while maintaining the brand equity LIV built in Miami.

## The Concept

**The Device Factory** explores the tension between digital overstimulation and genuine human experience. In a world where everyone's face is buried in a screen, LIV becomes the antidote—a space where you put the device away and actually *feel* something.

The visual language draws from industrial manufacturing aesthetics—chrome machinery, production lines, quality control stamps—but subverts them. Instead of producing devices, this factory produces moments. Memories. Connection.

## Visual System

The campaign operates on a strict visual rule set:

- **Chrome and steel** as primary materials
- **Stark contrast** between clinical manufacturing imagery and warm human moments
- **Typography** that feels stamped, pressed, industrial
- **Color palette** restricted to metallics, deep blacks, and singular accent bursts

## Deliverables

- Campaign concept and art direction
- Visual design system and guidelines
- Key art for digital and OOH
- Social content framework
- Environmental design consultation

## Results

Campaign launches Q1 2026. Case study will be updated with performance metrics post-launch.
