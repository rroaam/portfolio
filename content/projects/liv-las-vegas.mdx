## The Brief

LIV Las Vegas approached us to develop a comprehensive creative campaign for their 2026 launch. The challenge: differentiate in an oversaturated Vegas nightlife market while maintaining the brand equity LIV built in Miami.

## The Concept

**The Device Factory** explores the tension between digital overstimulation and genuine human experience. In a world where everyone's face is buried in a screen, LIV becomes the antidote—a space where you put the device away and actually *feel* something.
